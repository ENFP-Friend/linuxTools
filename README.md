## Mkhtml

Adds a generic .html file to your current directory and links it to /stylesheet/style.css.

## Install

chmod a+x mkhtml.sh
sudo cp mkhtml.sh /usr/local/bin

/usr/local/bin is usually in your PATH. You can check it via echo $PATH. Now you can simply do
mkhtml.sh and it'll execute.

If more tools are added I'll make a easy install script but for now this will do.

## Use

Type mkhtml in the terminal to populate the files
