# linuxTools
## Mkhtml

Adds a generic .html file to your current directory and links it to /stylesheet/style.css.

## Install

Copy and paste the text inside the .txt file to your .bshrc/.zshrc file and then source .bshrc/zshrc.

If more tools are added I'll make a easy install script but for now this will do.

## Use

Type mkhtml in the terminal to populate the files
